abstract = {Under sustained input current of increasing strength neurons eventually stop firing, entering a depolarization block. This is a robust effect that is not usually explored in experiments or explicitly implemented or tested in models. However, the range of current strength needed for a depolarization block could be easily reached with a random background activity of only a few hundred excitatory synapses. Depolarization block may thus be an important property of neurons that should be better characterized in experiments and explicitly taken into account in models at all implementation scales. Here we analyze the spiking dynamics of CA1 pyramidal neuron models using the same set of ionic currents on both an accurate morphological reconstruction and on its reduction to a single-compartment. The results show the specific ion channel properties and kinetics that are needed to reproduce the experimental findings, and how their interplay can drastically modulate the neuronal dynamics and the input current range leading to a depolarization block. We suggest that this can be one of the rate-limiting mechanisms protecting a CA1 neuron from excessive spiking activity.},

abstract = {GABA projection neurons (GABA neurons) in the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr) and dopamine projection neurons (DA neurons) in substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) have strikingly different firing properties. SNc DA neurons fire low-frequency, long-duration spikes, whereas SNr GABA neurons fire high-frequency, short-duration spikes. Since voltage-activated sodium (Na(V)) channels are critical to spike generation, the different firing properties raise the possibility that, compared with DA neurons, Na(V) channels in SNr GABA neurons have higher density, faster kinetics, and less cumulative inactivation. Our quantitative RT-PCR analysis on immunohistochemically identified nigral neurons indicated that mRNAs for pore-forming Na(V)1.1 and Na(V)1.6 subunits and regulatory Na(V)$\beta$1 and Na(v)$\beta$4 subunits are more abundant in SNr GABA neurons than SNc DA neurons. These $\alpha$-subunits and $\beta$-subunits are key subunits for forming Na(V) channels conducting the transient Na(V) current (I(NaT)), persistent Na current (I(NaP)), and resurgent Na current (I(NaR)). Nucleated patch-clamp recordings showed that I(NaT) had a higher density, a steeper voltage-dependent activation, and a faster deactivation in SNr GABA neurons than in SNc DA neurons. I(NaT) also recovered more quickly from inactivation and had less cumulative inactivation in SNr GABA neurons than in SNc DA neurons. Furthermore, compared with nigral DA neurons, SNr GABA neurons had a larger I(NaR) and I(NaP). Blockade of I(NaP) induced a larger hyperpolarization in SNr GABA neurons than in SNc DA neurons. Taken together, these results indicate that Na(V) channels expressed in fast-spiking SNr GABA neurons and slow-spiking SNc DA neurons are tailored to support their different spiking capabilities.},

@article{Qian2014,
abstract = {Dopamine neurons in freely moving rats often fire behaviorally relevant high-frequency bursts, but depolarization block limits the maximum steady firing rate of dopamine neurons in vitro to ∼10 Hz. Using a reduced model that faithfully reproduces the sodium current measured in these neurons, we show that adding an additional slow component of sodium channel inactivation, recently observed in these neurons, qualitatively changes in two different ways how the model enters into depolarization block. First, the slow time course of inactivation allows multiple spikes to be elicited during a strong depolarization prior to entry into depolarization block. Second, depolarization block occurs near or below the spike threshold, which ranges from -45 to -30 mV in vitro, because the additional slow component of inactivation negates the sodium window current. In the absence of the additional slow component of inactivation, this window current produces an N-shaped steady-state current-voltage (I-V) curve that prevents depolarization block in the experimentally observed voltage range near -40 mV. The time constant of recovery from slow inactivation during the interspike interval limits the maximum steady firing rate observed prior to entry into depolarization block. These qualitative features of the entry into depolarization block can be reversed experimentally by replacing the native sodium conductance with a virtual conductance lacking the slow component of inactivation. We show that the activation of NMDA and AMPA receptors can affect bursting and depolarization block in different ways, depending upon their relative contributions to depolarization versus to the total linear/nonlinear conductance.},

@article{Richards1997,
abstract = {Neurons in the substantia nigra pars reticulata and pars compacta of the rat were studied using a combination of intracellular electrophysiological recording in in vitro and subsequent immunocytochemical double and triple labelling techniques. The neurons recorded in the pars reticulata were identified as either GABA or dopamine neurons: neurons were considered to be GABA neurons if they were immunopositive for glutamate decarboxylase, whereas those neurons which were immunopositive for tyrosine hydroxylase were considered to be dopaminergic. The GABA neurons had short duration action potentials (0.45±0.03ms halfwidth), no apparent rectifying currents, no low threshold calcium spikes, were spontaneously active (7.4±3.7Hz), and could maintain high firing rates. The dopamine neurons had long duration action potentials (1.49±0.10ms), displayed both anomalous inward and transient outward rectifying currents, and more than half (12/17 neurons) displayed a low threshold calcium spike. Their spontaneous firing rate was lower than that of the GABA neurons (2.3±1.0Hz), and they displayed strong frequency adaptation. Morphological reconstruction of neurobiotin-filled neurons revealed that the pars reticulata GABA neurons had more extensive local dendritic arborization than the dopamine neurons from either the pars reticulata or the pars compacta. All of the neurons recorded from the pars compacta were dopamine neurons; they were found not to be different either electrophysiologically or morphologically from pars reticulata dopamine neurons. The electrophysiology of the GABA neurons suggests that input activity is translated linearly to spike frequency. These GABA neurons probably represent the projection neurons of the pars reticulata, and it is thus likely that this basal ganglia output is frequency coded. The close similarity between the dopamine neurons in the pars compacta, which give rise to the nigrostriatal pathway, and those in the pars reticulata supports the notion that the dopamine neurons in these two regions are part of the same neuronal population.},

@article{Seutin2010,
abstract = {Dopamine (DA) neurons and GABA neurons of the substantia nigra (SN) promote distinct functions in the control of movement and have different firing properties and action potential (AP) waveforms. APs recorded from DA and GABA neurons differed in amplitude, maximal rate of rise, and duration. In addition, the threshold potential for APs was higher in DA neurons than in GABA neurons. The activation of voltage-gated Na(+) channels accounts largely for these differences as the application of a low concentration of the voltage-gated Na(+) channel blocker TTX had an effect on all of these parameters. We have examined functional properties of somatic Na(+) channels in nucleated patches isolated from DA and GABA neurons. Peak amplitudes of macroscopic Na(+) currents were smaller in DA neurons in comparison to those in GABA neurons. The mean peak Na(+) conductance density was 24.5 pS microm(-2) in DA neurons and almost twice as large, 41.6 pS microm(-2), in GABA neurons. The voltage dependence of Na(+) channel activation was not different between the two types of SN neurons. Na(+) channels in DA and GABA neurons, however, differed in the voltage dependence of inactivation, the mean mid-point potential of steady-state inactivation curve being more positive in DA neurons than in GABA neurons. The results suggest that specific Na(+) channel gating properties and Na(+) conductance densities in the somatic membrane of SN neurons may have consequences on synaptic signal integration in the soma of both types of neurons and on somatodendritic release of dopamine by DA neurons.},

	abstract = {Human mutations of the GRID1 gene encoding the orphan delta1 glutamate receptor-channel (GluD1) are associated with schizophrenia but the explicit role of GluD1 in brain circuits is unknown. Based on the known function of its paralog GluD2 in cerebellum, we searched for a role of GluD1 in slow glutamatergic transmission mediated by metabotropic receptor mGlu1 in midbrain dopamine neurons, whose dysfunction is a hallmark of schizophrenia. We found that an mGlu1 agonist elicits a slow depolarizing current in HEK cells co-expressing mGlu1 and GluD1, but not in cells expressing mGlu1 or GluD1 alone. This current is abolished by additional co-expression of a dominant-negative GluD1 dead pore mutant. We then characterized mGlu1-dependent currents in dopamine neurons from midbrain slices. Both the agonist-evoked and the slow postsynaptic currents are abolished by expression of the dominant-negative GluD1 mutant, pointing to the involvement of native GluD1 channels in these currents. Likewise, both mGlu1-dependent currents are suppressed in GRID1 knockout mice, which reportedly display endophenotypes relevant for schizophrenia. It is known that mGlu1 activation triggers the transition from tonic to burst firing of dopamine neurons, which signals salient stimuli and encodes reward prediction. In vivo recordings of dopamine neurons showed that their spontaneous burst firing is abolished in GRID1 knockout mice or upon targeted expression of the dominant-negative GluD1 mutant in wild-type mice. Our results de-orphanize GluD1, unravel its key role in slow glutamatergic transmission and provide insights into how GRID1 gene alterations can lead to dopaminergic dysfunctions in schizophrenia.},

	abstract = "Antipsychotic drugs used in the treatment of schizophrenia have in common the property of being dopamine-receptor antagonists. However, the rapid timecourse of receptor blockade produced upon drug administration does not correlate with the emergence of clinical actions, which typically require weeks of treatment to become manifest. Studies in rats have shown that repeated antipsychotic drug treatment results in a delayed inactivation of dopamine-neuron firing in the midbrain due to depolarization block. Furthermore, the therapeutic efficacy of antipsychotic drugs in humans correlates with their ability to induce depolarization block of mesolimbic dopamine neurons, whereas their potential to produce extrapyramidal side effects correlates with their propensity for inducing depolarization block in the nigrostriatal dopamine system. Therefore, dopamine-cell depolarization block is an effective model for evaluating antipsychotic drug efficacy, and provides a potential mechanism to account for their therapeutic impact on a dysregulated dopamine system."

	abstract = {Dopaminergic neurons of the ventral midbrain fire high-frequency bursts when animals are presented with unexpected rewards, or stimuli that predict reward. To identify the afferents that can initiate bursting and establish therapeutic strategies for diseases affected by altered bursting, a mechanistic understanding of bursting is essential. Our results show that bursting is initiated by a specific interaction between the voltage sensitivity of NMDA receptors and voltage-gated ion channels that results in the activation of an intrinsic, action potential-independent, high-frequency membrane potential oscillation. We further show that the NMDA receptor is uniquely suited for this because of the rapid kinetics and voltage dependence imparted to it by Mg 2+ ion block and unblock. This mechanism explains the discrete nature of bursting in dopaminergic cells and demonstrates how synaptic signals may be reshaped by local intrinsic properties of a neuron before influencing action potential generation.

	abstract="Dopaminergic (DA) neurons of the mammalian midbrain exhibit unusually low firing frequencies in vitro. Furthermore, injection of depolarizing current induces depolarization block before high frequencies are achieved. The maximum steady and transient rates are about 10 and 20 Hz, respectively, despite the ability of these neurons to generate bursts at higher frequencies in vivo. We use a three-compartment model calibrated to reproduce DA neuron responses to several pharmacological manipulations to uncover mechanisms of frequency limitation. The model exhibits a slow oscillatory potential (SOP) dependent on the interplay between the L-type Ca2+ current and the small conductance K+ (SK) current that is unmasked by fast Na+ current block. Contrary to previous theoretical work, the SOP does not pace the steady spiking frequency in our model. The main currents that determine the spontaneous firing frequency are the subthreshold L-type Ca2+ and the A-type K+ currents. The model identifies the channel densities for the fast Na+ and the delayed rectifier K+ currents as critical parameters limiting the maximal steady frequency evoked by a depolarizing pulse. We hypothesize that the low maximal steady frequencies result from a low safety factor for action potential generation. In the model, the rate of Ca2+ accumulation in the distal dendrites controls the transient initial frequency in response to a depolarizing pulse. Similar results are obtained when the same model parameters are used in a multi-compartmental model with a realistic reconstructed morphology, indicating that the salient contributions of the dendritic architecture have been captured by the simpler model.",
